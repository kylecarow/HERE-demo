# HERE-demo
Quick demo of a simple HERE API call

### Useful resources

A list of all free HERE APIs can be found [here](https://developer.here.com/develop/rest-apis).

A helpful GPS waypoint / route-matching GUI can be found [here](https://tcs.ext.here.com/examples/v3/rme_basic).

### API key

To use HERE API services you first need to make a developer account and create a "Freemium" project. After this, you need to create an API key in the "REST" section of the project.

Be sure to create a text file called `API_KEY.json` in the same directory as this notebook with your API key. It should look like this:
```
{"API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"}
```
